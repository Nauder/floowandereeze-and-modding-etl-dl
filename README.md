## Overview

This project is an **Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline** designed to extract metadata from the global version of
the Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links game via **reverse engineering**, transform it into a structured format, and store the results
in **Parquet files**, mainly to be used by the Floowandereeze & Modding tool.

This project **does not** extract the assets themselves (e.g. png files containing art of cards), it only gets the
references to the bundles containing the data, which can be used for modding.

## Features

- **Extracts** game metadata by reverse engineering Unity game files. The data currently extracted includes:
  - Card Arts.
  - Sleeves.
  - Playmats.
- **Transforms** raw game data into a structured format, and cleans bad data.
- **Loads** the processed data into Parquet files for efficient storage and querying.

## Technologies Used

- [**Python**](https://www.python.org/) for scripting and data processing
- [**UnityPy**](https://github.com/K0lb3/UnityPy) for reverse engineering Unity assets
- [**pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data manipulation
- [**PIL**](https://pypi.org/project/pillow/) for image manipulation

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager
- Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links, with the in-game download complete

### Steps

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Nauder/floowandereeze-and-modding-dl-etl.git
cd floowandereeze-and-modding-dl-etl

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### ETL from Game Data

Replace the empty string in `config.json` with your game path.

Run the extraction script to pull data from Unity game files:

```sh
python .\etl\main.py
```

After extracting the data, it will be available as Parquet files inside the `data/` folder, as well as a `version.txt` file
containing the date of the last script run.

## Important Files Structure

```txt
├── data/                 # Final Parquet files
├── etl/
│   ├── services/         # Pipeline logic
│   ├── main.py           # Main script
│   └── util.py           # Utility functions
├── config.json           # Configurable parameters
└── README.md             # This
```

The `data/` folder in the repository contains the game metadata as of it's last push, so if there was no game update
after the last push it should already be up to date.

## Configuration

Modify the values in `config.json`, the configurations are:

- **game_path** path to your Duel Links installation's user data, up to the LocalData folder.
- **num_threads** amount of threads to use when extracting data, performance varies by hardware.
- **excluded_sleeves** sleeve assets to be ignored when building the list of sleeves. The game names sleeve materials
the same way as animated sleeve frames, so they are removed manually.

The only mandatory configuration is the **game_path**, the rest come with default values that should be appropriate for most cases.

## CI/CD

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and code quality checks:

- **Pylint**: Runs on every push and pull request to the main branch to ensure code quality and catch potential errors.
The check requires a minimum score of 9/10.
- **Black**: Runs on every push and pull request to the main branch to enforce consistent code formatting across the
project.

## Known Issues

- The card name is obtained using the YGOPro API, which is not guaranteed to be accurate or complete.
A more reliable approach would be to decrypt the files containing the card names, but this is not 
implemented yet.
